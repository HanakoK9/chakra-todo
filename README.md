# Getting Started with Create React App

## todo app -
This is a simple todo app with React JS I made while trying my hands on chakra UI. It uses localstorage to  store data

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
